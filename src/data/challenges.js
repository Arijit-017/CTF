But inside I hold a hidden thrill.
Use a tool that sneaks and hides,
Where secrets in the pixels ride.
My keeper's name will break the lock —
Just whisper mayank, and you’ll unlock the talk.

Hint - Use steghide tool`,

One stands tall with ISTE pride.
Chairperson's is the one you seek,
Their LinkedIn holds the clue you need.
Not in posts, but somewhere neat,
Where bios end and breadcrumbs meet.
A hidden hint, a secret tag —
Follow it well to find your flag.

But secrets hide beneath its sheet.
The time it was taken, the place it might show,
Even the phone or the camera you know.
Want to find out what's lurking inside?
Use this clever tool, let metadata be your guide.
Run it on an image, don’t be a fool—
What’s the name of this powerful tool?

What am I?`,

But tools online admit defeat.
Use the list that hackers trust,
And crack it well — crack it must.
One tool, John, knows what to do —
Feed it right, it’ll guide you through."

    description: `A clean front hides what lies beneath,
Not all is shown upon first breathe.
The server holds more than you can see,
But only the curious will find the key.
Send silent knocks, one by one,
Until you find the hidden run.
Peek inside the lines once there —
A whispered secret hides somewhere.

Slice me open right down the core, where mystery likes to reside.
Though I look the same to every eye, I whisper in strings if you pry.
Find my truth not at the start or end —
But buried where the bytes descend.`,

    description: `Before you lies a guarded gate,
A name well-known will seal your fate.
“KunalRajnish” walks in with pride,
But his secret stays well locked inside.

You hold the words, a sacred scroll,
One among them can make you whole.
No strength or sword, no magic art—
Just patient minds and a hacker’s heart.

When guess meets truth, the doors swing wide,
And hidden within, the flag will reside.
